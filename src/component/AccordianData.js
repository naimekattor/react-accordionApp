question:"What is accordion style?",
answer:"An accordion is a menu composed of vertically stacked headers that reveal more details when triggered (often by a mouse click). Since this web design pattern highlights only the most critical information of a section but makes the rest easily accessible, it's a common element in responsive design."

{id:3,
  question:"Why use an accordion?",
  answer:"While accordions can simplify long content pages and minimize scrolling, they diminish content visibility and increase interaction cost. On desktop, use accordions for content-heavy pages where users will not need to access content under several accordions."
